# Tic-Tac-Toe Starter Project : GitHub Repository

This project is part of [Udacity](https://www.udacity.com "Udacity - Be in demand")'s [VR Developer Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/vr-developer-nanodegree--nd017).

The goal of this project was to optimize a poorly implemented app to run effectively on mobile.
The following steps were taken:
- Change all high poly 3D models to lower poly models
- To reduce SetPass Calls, remove individual textures from objects, and use texture atlases instead
- Set lighting to baked and non-moving objects to static
- Update Quality Settings to be suitable for mobile
- Deploy on test device, and use the Unity Profiler to remotely track performance on test equipment

## Versions
- Unity 2018.1.1f1
- GVR Unity SDK v1.70.0
